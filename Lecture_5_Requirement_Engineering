Continue from same lecture last session:

learning environment, like presciption and rail road 
domain engineering is getting familiar to relation ships between things

	Examples of modeling requirements
	Example 2: A study abroud system
a study abroad management system
	A Domain Model: another example
the moviebd.org the UML notation (unified Modeling Language)-standart notation for modeling real-world objects as first step designing an OOP system



	Requirements Elicitation
objective: identify the key stakeholders, communicate & collaborate to identify and document product features

stakeholder-driven: rely on stakeholder to design products, and their feedback as dev product to make any change necessary
+through interview, observation, ethnographic studies(study people in their environment), group sessions etc
+important stakeholders: people who has influence over finish product, 
+build shared understanding of problems, critical to complete, adequate realistic requirments
+stakeholder's analysis based on their role, interest, type of knowledge they contribute-no necessay always right, know what they know, want 

artifact-driven: gather info of the was-system and tobe-system, follow existing doc to understand sys as it was
+background, collect data, survey, reports, scenarios, storyboards, etc

	Types of Requirements
Functional and Non-Functional requirements, and Constraints
-Fucntional:
	+what aspects, what the system should do? focus on features of the products
-Non-Functional:
	+define constrains that products must meet its requirements: performance,security,protability,reliability,interoperability,etc...
	+constraints: ex: specific language to build the product, how should it fit with the requirements, what frame work will be implemented.

	
	Example of Functional requirements-medical applications:
allow record, view medical histories, generate report on patients data, order medications, schedule appointment, communicate with healthcare provider.

	Example of Non-functional requirement(quality) requirements-medical applications:
application secure and protect data, reliable and available 24/7, user friendly, meet appllicable regulations

	Example of Constraints:
application use open-source software, hosted on-premises, meet deadline, fit with budget, compatible with existing health care system

		REQUIREMENTS MODELING AND DOCUMENTATION

	Requirements documentations
detailing, structuring, documenting characteristics of new software
