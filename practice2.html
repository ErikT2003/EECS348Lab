<p id="myParagraph"> Quote from ScreenSlaver, a character in the movie The Incredible "...you eat chips and watch her invert problems that you are too lazy to deal with. Superheroes are part of your brainless desire to replace true experience with simulation. You don't talk, you watch talk shows. You don't play games, you watch game shows. Travel, relationships, risk; every meaningful experience must be packaged and delivered to you to watch at a distance so that you can remain ever-sheltered, ever-passive, ever-ravenous consumers who can't free themselves to rise from their couches, break a sweat, and participate in life. You want superheroes to protect you, and make yourselves ever more powerless in the process. While you tell yourselves you're being "looked after". That your interests are being served and your rights are being upheld. So that the system can keep stealing from you, smiling at you all the while. .. " by (ScreenSlaver-The Incredibles)</p>
